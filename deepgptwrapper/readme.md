## We built a cool ML tool
Oxxo is one of the most popular convenience stores in Mexico, they've recently faced a problem to determine weather a location (lat, lon) will be a successful location for their store. Our goal is to develop a predictive model that can assess this issue by receiving the latitude and longitude as input

## How does it work?

## Our features
- ✅ View heatmap of Oxxo stores in the Monterrey metropolitan area
- ✅ Map division in importance zones for the company
- ✅ Return Top 3 stores depending on a selected location
- ✅ Provide additional insights from internal data for each store selected
- ✅ Use of GradientBoostingRegressor model with r-squared = .83
- ✅ Used external data-sets for schools, 911 reports, population-density and close-competition

## External Databases Used
- [911 Reports](https://mide.monterrey.gob.mx/catalogue/uuid/33c3a891-a72d-46c1-af5e-f957e069a585)  
- [Schools](https://mide.monterrey.gob.mx/catalogue/uuid/bd4a29cf-3c17-4080-80a6-95cbec757b8a)  
- [Location of Oxxo competitors](https://www.inegi.org.mx/app/mapa/denue/default.aspx)  
- [Population density per municipality](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Municipios_de_Nuevo_Le%C3%B3n)  


## Installation

To install all of the dependencies, you'll need to first make a virtual environment like so :
```bash
py -m venv .venv
```
Next, you'll want to activate the venv like so:
```bash
.venv/Scripts/activate
```
Now navigate to the `backend` directory.
Then, you'll want to install all backend dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Also, please note that this is a project built on top of Streamlit, and so you'll need a `.streamlit` folder with a `secrets.toml` file with all of your streamlit api keys.
