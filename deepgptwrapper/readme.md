## We built a cool ML tool
Oxxo is one of the most popular convenience stores in Mexico, they've recently faced a problem to determine weather a location (lat, lon) will be a successful location for their store. Our goal is to develop a predictive model that can assess this issue by receiving the latitude and longitude as input

## How does it work?

## Our features
- ✅ View heatmap of Oxxo stores in the Monterrey metropolitan area
- ✅ Map division in importance zones for the company
- ✅ Return Top 3 stores depending on a selected location
- ✅ Provide additional insights from internal data for each store selected
- ✅ Use of GradientBoostingRegressor model with r-squared = .83
- ✅ Used external data-sets for schools, 911 reports, population-density and close-competition

## Demo 



## Installation

To install all of the dependencies, you'll need to first make a virtual environment like so :
bash
py -m venv .venv

Next, you'll want to activate the venv like so:
bash
.venv/Scripts/activate

Now navigate to the backend directory.
Then, you'll want to install all backend dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


Also, please note that this is a project built on top of Streamlit, and so you'll need a .streamlit folder with a secrets.toml file with all of your streamlit api keys.
